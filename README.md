# about cribsheets

learning to program is daunting. looking out from a position
of no experience into the seething abyss of languages,
frameworks, opinions, databases, operating systems, and
worse, you'd be forgiven for thinking 'there be dragons' and
turning your ship around.

yes, there are dragons. they can, with a lot of time and
patience, be _your_ dragons.

there are a number of core activities and skills that comprise
most programming activity. as programmers, we solve unique
problems, but we do so using familiar tools and techniques.
after some practice, these tools become more like muscle
memory, and we can focus on solving the actual problem instead
of figuring out how our tools work.

our goal with `cribsheets` is to provide some exercises, problems,
and tools to help you develop that muscle memory so you can
start focusing on solving the actual problem. along the way, 
we'll also build a few starter kits so you can avoid the tedium
of project startup and get to the real work.

as of today (2019-01-29), we'll start adding things to this github
organization. my intention is to represent a few exercises in several
languages and frameworks, solutions to the exercises, several
starter kits, and some docs that can serve as crib sheets and
early guidance for programmers who want a second opinion or a
little guidance.

please help! if you have some ideas, or want to contribute, or
just have an opinion on how we're doing it right or wrong, please
get in touch. general ideas, new exercises, advice and commentary
can be written as an issue on this repository. project-specific
communication should target the issues on the appropriate repo.

thank you in advance for your advice, support, and assistance.

below is a guide to what's where. it will start out thin, and
hopefully will fill itself out before web run out of steam. some
of the things listed below are skills we want to exercise---these
will eventually be named exercises instead of simple intent.

# exercises (basic)

## fizzbuzz

this exercise is often used in interviews, as it confounds
many new programmers. we've provided the problem in several
languages---pick the one you like, and follow the bouncing
ball.

* python : [http://github.com/cribsheets/fizzbuzz-python](http://github.com/cribsheets/fizzbuzz-python)
* ruby : [http://github.com/cribsheets/fizzbuzz-ruby](http://github.com/cribsheets/fizzbuzz-ruby)

* elixir : [http://github.com/cribsheets/fizzbuzz-elixir](http://github.com/cribsheets/fizzbuzz-elixir)

## fibonacci numbers

this exercise is well known. you can solve it two ways,
using either a loop or using recursion.

* python : [http://github.com/cribsheets/fibonacci-python](http://github.com/cribsheets/fibonacci-python)
* clojure : [http://github.com/cribsheets/fibonacci-clojure](http://github.com/cribsheets/fibonacci-clojure)
